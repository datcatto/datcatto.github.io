                doing well and able to adjust to your new life 
                specially being a grade 11 student, I know you'll 
                face challenges and struggles but always remember
                that no matter what you'll overcome it and I know 
                that you won't back down easily with some setbacks so I 
                hope you pursue and excell in your chosen path and academics.
                I deeply care for you and from the bottom of my heart
                I wish for the very best for you and may you prosper
                and achieve all the great things you're destined for.
